Hello!

I'm Pablo Ubilla Pavez, and I'm about to start my PhD with the
[EVERGREEN group](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/) at
[Inria Montpellier](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-branch-university-montpellier).

I’m broadly interested in machine learning, statistics and operations research. I have mostly worked in applications related to ecology, society, and political elections. I'm also open to applications in other interesting fields and on the methodological and theoretical aspects of these topics.

I completed an MSc in Ecology & Data Science at
[University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) (2024), where I was supervised by [Daniel Maynard](https://www.maynardlab.co.uk/). Before that I completed a Master's in Operations Management at [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl), supervised by [Charles Thraves](https://cthraves.com/). I got my (very long) Industrial Engineering degree at the same university. 

When I’m not working, I enjoy playing piano & guitar, and rock climbing. I am also trying to learn French right now.
