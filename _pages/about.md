I'm Pablo Ubilla Pavez, and I'm about to start my PhD with the
[EVERGREEN group](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/) at
[Inria Montpellier](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-montpellier).

I’m broadly interested in machine learning and operations research, especially
when applied to problems in ecology, society, and conservation — and other
interesting challenges that might come my way.

Before this, I completed an MSc in _Ecology and Data Science_ at
[University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) (2024). Earlier, I
earned a Master's in _Operations Management_ (2023) and a Professional Degree in
_Industrial Engineering_ from the [University of Chile](https://www.uchile.cl).

When I’m not working, I enjoy playing music and bouldering.

Feel free to reach out, check out my [publications](/publications/) (yet to
come), or connect via the links below.
