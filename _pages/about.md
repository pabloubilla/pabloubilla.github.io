<!-- Hello!

I'm Pablo Ubilla Pavez, and I'm about to start my PhD with the
[EVERGREEN group](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/) at
[Inria Montpellier](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-branch-university-montpellier). -->

Hola, Hello, Bonjour! I'm Pablo.

I’m interested in machine learning and statistics. In particular, I am interested on developing methods that help us undertand and protect our natural world. My main focus is on ecology and biodiversity, but I’ve also worked on projects in elections, surveys, pricing, and vehicle routing.

Right now, I am doing a PhD at [Inria Montpellier](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-branch-university-montpellier) with the [EVERGREEN group](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/), supervised by [Diego Marcos](https://sites.google.com/view/diego-marcos/home). I am working on machine learning methods applied to species distribution models.

I was formed as an Industrial Engineer at [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl), where I became interested in optimization and probabilities. That led me to pursue a Master’s in Operations Management in the same university, supervised by [Charles Thraves](https://cthraves.com/). Besides engineering, I've always been fascinated by the natural world and its species, so to bring that passion with my background, I went on to do a second Master's in Ecology & Data Science at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) (2024), supervised by [Daniel Maynard](https://www.maynardlab.co.uk/).

Outside of research stuff, I’ve always enjoyed playing music, and somewhat recently I’ve taken up rock climbing. I'm also learning extremely basic French (*je suis un garçon*).
