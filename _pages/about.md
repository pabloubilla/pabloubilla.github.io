<!-- Hello!

I'm Pablo Ubilla Pavez, and I'm about to start my PhD with the
[EVERGREEN group](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/) at
[Inria Montpellier](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-branch-university-montpellier). -->

Hola! I'm Pablo.

I'm broadly interested in machine learning, statistics, and operations research. At the moment, I'm working on applications in ecology and biodiversity, but I've also tackled problems related to vehicle routing, political elections, surveys, and pricing. I'm always open to other interesting applications, as well as the more theoretical sides of these fields.

I was formed as an Industrial Engineer at [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl), where I became interested in optimization and probabilities. That led me to pursue a Master’s in Operations Management in the same university, supervised by [Charles Thraves](https://cthraves.com/). Besides engineering, I've always been fascinated by the natural world and its species, so to bring that passion with my background, I went on to do a second Master's in Ecology & Data Science at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) (2024), supervised by [Daniel Maynard](https://www.maynardlab.co.uk/).

Outside of research stuff, I’ve always enjoyed playing music, and somewhat recently I’ve taken up rock climbing. I'm also learning extremely basic French (*je suis un garçon*).
