I will be starting my PhD at INRIA Montpellier!

<!-- As of October 2025, I will be working on my PhD at INRIA Montpellier, under the supervision of [Diego Marcos](https://sites.google.com/view/diego-marcos/home) at the [EVERGREEN](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/) lab. My research will be on machine learning methods applied to species distribution models.

Very happy c: -->
